# Assignment

Develop a program for managing a library using the Java programming language. The program must satisfy the following conditions:

## Creational GoF Patterns
- Utilize the Factory Method pattern to create instances of books of different genres.

## Structural GoF Patterns
- Apply the Decorator pattern to extend the functionality of books, adding the ability to include additional descriptions or covers.

## Behavioral GoF Patterns
- Use the Observer pattern to implement a mechanism for notifying users about the appearance of new books in the library.

## Other GoF Patterns
- Singleton pattern for connecting to the mail server to send notifications to users.
- Adapter pattern for converting book data from different sources (e.g., databases, APIs) into a format compatible with the program.
- Iterator pattern for traversing the collection of books and performing operations on them.
- Command pattern for implementing user interactions with the library, such as adding a book, removing a book, and searching for a book.
- Template Method pattern for describing a common book search algorithm that can be overridden in subclasses to implement specific search strategies.

Students are given freedom in implementing the details, but they are required to demonstrate the use of the specified GoF patterns. Additionally, students may implement additional features at their discretion to enhance the functionality of the program.
